## Directions

### Step #1 - What's your name? <br>

This program says hi to you at a random point on the screen. Change the name variable so it says your name instead.
<br><br>
Hint: Your name should be a string, so make sure you keep it inside "quotation marks".
<br><br>

### Step #2 - Function-ize it! <br>

It's time to wrap your code in a function:
<br>
- Start off by creating a new function, paying close attention to (parenthesis) and {curly braces} ;
- Move all of your code inside the function;
- Call your new function once to make sure it works.
<br><br>
Bonus: Indent the code inside the function, by selecting it and clicking TAB. It doesn't change the result, but it makes the code look nicer and easier to read ^ . ^
<br><br>
### Step #3 - Keep calling it! <br>
Now that we have it in a function, it's easy for us to call it multiple times. Call it at least 3 more times! Names everywhere!
<br><br>
### Step #4 - Add a feature! <br>

Try to add one of the following extra features to this lesson:
